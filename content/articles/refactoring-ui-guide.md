The following are some of the best tips to follow when using Refactoring UI:

## 1. Keep it Simple and Consistent

One of the most important principles of good design is simplicity. Users need to be able to navigate through your interface with ease. Keep your designs simple and avoid clutter. Use consistent visual elements such as colors, typography, and spacing to create a cohesive design that is easy to understand and navigate.

By keeping your design simple and consistent, you can help your users navigate through your interface with ease. Simple and consistent designs are not only easier to use, but also more aesthetically pleasing.

## 2. Use Clear and Readable Typography

Typography is an essential element of design that can greatly impact the readability and user experience of your interface. Choose clear and readable fonts and use them consistently throughout your design. Pay attention to font size, spacing, and line height to ensure that your text is easy to read.

The typography you choose can make or break your design. Using clear and readable fonts will help your users read your content with ease. Additionally, by using consistent typography throughout your design, you can create a cohesive and professional look.

## 3. Balance Your Layout

A balanced layout is essential to creating a visually pleasing design. Use the rule of thirds to create a balanced composition, and pay attention to the placement of your visual elements. Use white space to create a sense of breathing room and avoid overcrowding your design.
